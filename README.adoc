This is the GruntWurk Core for Python -- Just another Python project framework.
It provides support for any type of Python project, especially:

* Command-Line only tools (e.g. stdin -> stdout filters)
* A "simple control panel" framework for a quick-and-dirty app with lots of buttons that launch various scripts.
* Any project that calls for: logging, standardized exit codes, command-line options, INI configs.

It also contains a collection of one-off "housekeeping" functions like installing a TTF font in Windows.

NOTE: This library was developed in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
Everything should work in Python 3.6 and/or on non-Windows boxes, but no guarantees either way.


Coming Soon: Cookie-cutter templates that utilize the GruntWurk Core to jump-start your projects.
