== Logging

Messages regarding how the data processing is going can be sent to two places:
A succinct log is sent to the console (to `stderr` to be precise).
An optional detailed log can be written to a file on disk.

Use the `--logfile` switch to specify the name of a log file to use.

By default, the version of the log written to the console (`stderr`) excludes diagnostic and debugging messages.
Use the `--verbose`, `--debug`, or `--trace` switches to see more.
(`--debug` is very verbose. `--trace` is very, very verbose.)

Log messages sent to the console are colorized by default.
The `--nocolor` switch turns this off.
Also, if `stderr` is redirected away from the console, then coloring is automatically turned off.
