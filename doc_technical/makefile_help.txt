== One-Time Setup Goals ==
    activate     -- Installs and activates the virtual environment.
    dev-env      -- Installs requirements, etc.

== Regular Goals ==
    test         -- Runs all of the unit tests.
    examples     -- Runs the example code.
    standardize  -- Apply the linting tools (format, isort, and lint) to all of the .py files.
    prep         -- Prepares for a possible release.
    dist         -- Build a distribution.
    clean        -- Deletes all temporary files.
    help         -- This list.

== Sub-Goals (can be executed explicitly, if desired) ==
    pip          -- Upgrade pip to the latest
    requirements -- Ensures that all of the modules required by this project are installed (in the virtual env).
    format       -- Re-formats all of the Python code (with black).
    isort        -- Cleans up all of the imports (using isort).
    lint         -- Lints code (using flake8).
