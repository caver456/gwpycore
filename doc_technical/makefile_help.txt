== One-Time Setup Goals ==
    dev-env     -- Sets up the virtual environment, installs requirements, etc.

== Regular Goals ==
    test        -- Runs all of the unit tests.
    examples    -- Runs the example code.
    standardize -- Apply the linting tools (format, isort, and lint) to all of the .py files.
    prep        -- Prepares for a possible release.
    clean       -- Deletes all temporary files.
    help        -- This list.

== Sub-Goals (can be executed explicitly, if desired) ==
    activate     -- 'Activate' the virtual environment.
    requirements -- Ensures that all of the modules required by this project are installed (in the virtual env).
    format       -- Re-formats all of the Python code (with black).
    isort        -- Cleans up all of the imports (using isort).
    lint         -- Lints code (using flake8).
